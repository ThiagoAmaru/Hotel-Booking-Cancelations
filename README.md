# Problem Statement

One of the common main problems the hotels facing are cancellations. There are several problems due to cancellations, including: operational problems, replanning of tasks, inaccuracy in revenue forecasts, poor optimization of resources such as occupancy of rooms..

This study contains informations about a Ciy Hotel and a Resort Hotel in the period between July 2015 and August 2017, the City Hotel is located in Lisbon, capital of Portugal and the Resort Hotel in Algarve, a coastal city also from Portugal.


# Objective

* Develop a machine learning model capable of predicting which customers are most likely to cancel a reservation
* Identify which are the main features available in the database that identify whether the customer will cancel or not
* Present a possible business plan based on the results obtained.<br><br>
