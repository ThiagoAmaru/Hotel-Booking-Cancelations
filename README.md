## Problem Statement

One of the common hotel problems facing sudden cancellations, this study contains a Hotel da Cidade and a Hotel Resort in the period from July 2015 to August 2017, both are staying in similar hotels in Portugal, City Hotel in Lisbon and Resort Hotel in Algarve, a coastal city. It was asked by the manager what are the main reasons that make customers cancel.

## Objective
**Main:**
* Analyze the given database and create insights about the customers, the most chosen period for travel, the chosen package, the rooms, the food, etc.
* Develop a machine learning mode capable of predict cancelations.

**Extra:**    
* Transform manager excel sheets into sql files using sqlite3
